# Final Project: Note Taking App
I have created a note webapp.
You can create different categories in the `Edit Boards` page.
Every deleted note is placed in the `Archive` page until it is deleted.
All data is stored using localStorage.

This project uses the concepts we learned throughout class. It uses flexbox in multiple places, media queries for dynamic layouts, event listeners, and more.
